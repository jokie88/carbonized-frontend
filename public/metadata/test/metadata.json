  "description": "The Genesis Stone is the world\u2019s first carbonized NFT. \r\n\r\nIt captures carbon from the atmosphere by consuming tokens representing carbon offsets that have been bridged on-chain, specifically Base Carbon Tonne tokens (BCT). \r\n\r\nWe chose a rock for the first carbonized NFT in existence as a nod to the EtherRock, which became a flashpoint of criticism surrounding the value of NFTs. Were they simply jpegs? We believe carbonized NFTs offer a compelling argument in that debate.\r\n\r\nThe surface of The Genesis Stone was modeled to resemble basalt - a carbon-capturing rock that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions that react with CO2. The diamond-like shape of The Genesis Stone loosely imitates the Ethereum logo, as an acknowledgment of the technological innovation of the Ethereum blockchain. On the surface of The Genesis Stone is a trace of green moss, symbolizing the life-giving intent of carbonized NFTs.\r\n\r\nOnly 100 Genesis Stones will be available to mint. \r\n",
