  "name": "Genesis Stone", 
  "description": "The Genesis Stone is the worldâ€™s first carbonized NFT.\n\nIt captures carbon from the atmosphere by consuming tokens representing carbon offsets that have been bridged on-chain, specifically Base Carbon Tonne tokens (BCT). \n\nWe chose a rock for the first carbonized NFT in existence as a nod to the controversial EtherRock NFT, which many critiqued in context of the greater question surrounding the value of NFTs. Were they simply jpegs? We believe carbonized NFTs offer a new argument to be considered in that debate.\n\nThe surface of the Genesis Stone was modeled to resemble basalt - a carbon capturing igneous rock that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions that react with CO2. The diamond-like shape of the Genesis Stone loosely imitates the Ethereum logo, as an acknowledgment of the technological innovation of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOn its surface grow moss and lichens, which symbolize the life-giving intent of carbonized NFTs.",
